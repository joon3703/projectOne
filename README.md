Project 1 for (Joonwoo Choi, Josh Manuel, Thomas Sulik)
Play a real time game of chess with a real person remotely.

We looked at different javascript chess game APIs we could incorporate into our project.
We discussed all the cool features we could include in this app, then narrowed it down to the MVP.

MVP:
Log in two users
Make moves that can be shared across two devices
Exchange text messages with your opponent during the game. 

Additional features (wish list):
A list of potential opponents currently online.
Tracking each move on a scoresheet.
Backing up games and storing after youâ€™ve played them.
An in-app ranking of players on a weekly leaderboard.

We each chose to work on those features that interested us the most.

We used chessboard.js for the basic functions os a chess game. 
We used Materialize for the front end.
We used Firebase database to register users and update the positions on the board after each move.
